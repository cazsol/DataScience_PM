	example: How to know what is important for customers
		Ask them -> they do not know what they want, they want everything but dont want to pay, they do not really weight what is more important (no discrimination)
	How to undesrstand the more importatn attributes
		Dedicate time to the design of the evaluation
		attributes shoudl be independet from the rest
		select attribute values that are relevant (price)
		cards are options (cards is slang for product management)

		You rank the cards according to the attributed
		These rankings can be used to calculate utilities 
		Methods
			full-factorial: you consider everything
			Fractional/Orthogonal design: subset of all combinations but allow extrapolation
		The information is compiled to calculate part woths (which means evaluating how valueable is an attribute)

		You cannot compare the value of the level of an attribute to another level of another attribute

		You can compare difference between difference in the level of the attributes

		Analytic Hierarchical Process
